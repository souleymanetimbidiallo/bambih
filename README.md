## About Bambih

the Idea: Online Real estate company ( with the possibility to directly rent and have your renting contract online,calendar and all the  )
How did the idea come to me? 

I have studied in Senegal for 2 years and a half and in Spain for seven months and in the next months I will travel to Kenya and there is one question that always comes first to me when planning long stay travel: HOUSING 

Housing is a huge issue today all over the world but especially in Africa and specifically for youth ( under 30 ) mostly students and young professionals traveling in different countries for studies, intern or work. And at the same time, the use of the internet is increasing on the continent so there is a question to answer: Why not use the internet as in European countries to solve our housing problems?
